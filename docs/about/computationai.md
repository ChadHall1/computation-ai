# Computation AI

Within the [AIAA Organization](https://aiaa.org)
and as part of the [DEIC](https://www.aiaa.org/committees/digital-engineering-integration-committee),
the Computation AI Subcommittee is focused
on looking at the ways where computer aided engineering (CAE),
high-performance computing (HPC), and AI topics come together to deliver value.
